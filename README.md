Here I have played with various algorithms to predict hand motions using recordings of electroencephalogram, thanks Kaggle for the dataset. The best result comes with an AUC score greater than 0.7.

This demonstrates the advancements in interpreting EEG signals which has the potential to provide affordable, low-risk, non-invasive BCI (brain-computer interface) devices
