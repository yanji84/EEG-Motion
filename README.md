Machine learning algorithm to predict hand motions using recordings of electroencephalogram with an AUC score that is close to 0.80. This demonstrates the advancements in interpreting EEG signals which has the potential to provide affordable, low-risk, non-invasive BCI (brain-computer interface) devices
